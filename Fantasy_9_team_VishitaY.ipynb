        "\n",
        "This project focuses on utilizing linear optimization techniques to create an optimal fantasy team for a given budget and set of constraints. The goal is to select a team of players from a pool of available options that maximizes the expected points while adhering to various constraints such as budget limitations and position requirements.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Project Overview**\n",
        "\n",
        "The objective of this project is to leverage linear integer optimization algorithms to create a fantasy team that maximizes the total expected points within the constraints of a predefined budget and position requirements. By formulating the problem as a linear programming model, we aim to find an optimal combination of players that provides the highest expected performance while staying within the specified budget and fulfilling position-specific requirements.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Features**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Linear Optimization:** The project utilizes linear optimization techniques to solve the fantasy team selection problem. By formulating the problem as a integer programming model, the code aims to find the best combination of players that maximize the expected points while adhering to the given constraints.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Budget Constraint:** The project incorporates a budget constraint, ensuring that the total cost of the selected players does not exceed the available budget. This constraint ensures that the team remains within the budget limitations while aiming to maximize the expected points.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Position Constraints:** The project also takes into account position-specific constraints. These constraints specify the required number of players for each position (e.g., quarterback, running back, wide receiver) in the fantasy team. By including position constraints, the code ensures that the team composition aligns with the desired lineup structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Usage**\n",
        "To utilize the fantasy team creation code, follow these steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "Provide the player dataset: Prepare a dataset containing player information, including their positions, expected points, and costs. Ensure the dataset is structured appropriately for the code to extract the necessary information.\n",
        "\n",
        "Set the budget and constraints: Define the budget available for selecting players and specify the position constraints (e.g., the required number of players for each position) according to your fantasy team requirements.\n",
        "\n",
        "Execute the code: Run the provided code to create an optimal fantasy team. The code utilizes linear optimization techniques to find the combination of players that maximizes the expected points while adhering to the specified budget and position constraints.\n",
        "\n",
        "Review the results: Examine the output of the code, which includes the selected players for the fantasy team, the total expected points, and the total cost. Analyze these results to assess the composition and performance of the generated team."

        "\n",
        "- `model1.qb[i]` is a binary variable that equals 1 if the QB at index `i` is selected and 0 otherwise.\n",

        "When evaluating the constraint, we consider the following scenarios:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. If `model1.qb[i]` is 0 (QB not selected), the constraint is satisfied because there is no requirement for WRs or TEs from the QB's team.\n",

        "2. If `model1.qb[i]` is 1 (QB selected), the constraint checks if the number of WRs and TEs from the QB's team (`total_te_wr_same_team`) is at least 2. If the condition `model1.qb[i] * 2 <= total_te_wr_same_team` holds true, it means that there are at least 2 WRs or TEs from the QB's team in the lineup, satisfying the stacking requirement. If the condition is not met, it indicates that there are fewer than 2 WRs or TEs from the QB's team, violating the stacking constraint.\n",
        "\n",
        "By including this constraint, the optimization model ensures that if a QB is selected, there are enough WRs or TEs from the same team to support the stacking strategy.
